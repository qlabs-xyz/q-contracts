# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project. 
An ADR is a document that captures an architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. 
The ADRs are numbered sequentially and are written in markdown format.

## UML Diagrams Support

The ADRs can include UML diagrams. The diagrams are stored in the `puml` folder and 
written in [PlantUml](https://plantuml.com/).

To render the diagrams in the ADRs, the [markdown file](https://github.com/danielyaa5/puml-for-markdown) 
should include a link to the diagram file and just run:

```shell
puml-for-markdown
```
